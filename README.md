## Hack the system, remove the noise

Are you tired of endless political debates cluttering your X feed? Say goodbye to unwanted political content!

### Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Users vote on political content, creating a collective shield against unwanted tweets.
- **Real-time Processing**: Instantly removes voted-out tweets from your feed.
- **Easy to use**: Integrates seamlessly with X's interface, adding a subtle thumbs-down button to each tweet.
- **Privacy-Focused**: No personal data stored; we only track tweet IDs.

### How It Works

1. **Vote**: See a political tweet? Hit the thumbs-down button. The tweet will instantly disappear from your feed and be saved in your browser's local storage.
2. **Process**: Our backend tallies votes across users.
3. **Filter**: Tweets exceeding the community vote threshold vanish from all users' feeds.
4. **Personalization**: Even if a tweet doesn't reach the community threshold, it will always be hidden for you if you've downvoted it, thanks to your browser's local storage.
